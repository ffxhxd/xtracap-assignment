# Photo Explorer

Photo Explorer is a React application that utilizes the Unsplash API to display and search for photos. It features a responsive design, infinite scrolling, and an autocomplete search bar with saved suggestions.

## Features

- **Default Image Display**: On initial load, the application displays a set of random photos fetched from the Unsplash API.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for photos using a fixed search bar at the top of the page. As users type, search results are displayed in real time.
- **Infinite Scroll**: The application loads more images as the user scrolls down, providing a seamless browsing experience.
- **Search Suggestions**: User search queries are saved locally, and previous searches are suggested as tags near the search bar when the user interacts with it again.
- **Photo Preview Modal**: Clicking on a photo opens it in a modal, allowing for a closer view.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across different device sizes.
- **Loaders and Placeholders**: Appropriate loading indicators are shown while photos are being fetched or loaded.
## Technologies Used

- ReactJS
- Material-UI (MUI) for the user interface components
